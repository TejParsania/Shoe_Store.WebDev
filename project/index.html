<h2>How a Single Pair of Sneakers Explains the Booming Billion-Dollar Sneaker Resale Industry</h2>
<p><time datetime="2019-08-16">Posted by Cam Wolf, August 16, 2019</time</p>

<p>Zac leans into the pair of sneakers in his hands and takes a great big whiff—the sort of noisy inhale typically reserved for fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies and the heads of newborn babies. Zac is a sneaker authenticator at Stadium Goods, the New York-based sneaker-resale company, where people frequently buy and sell footwear for thousands of dollars. They are entrusting Zac’s nostrils to safeguard their investment. Today, he is eagerly hoovering the vapors from a pair of Nike x Supreme SB Dunks from 2002 that have been on a long and telling voyage—one that says a lot about the booming, and still-growing, sneaker resale industry.</p>

<p>The sniff, Zac says, is his favorite way to tell a legitimate shoe from a fake one. He guesses he’s personally checked over a million shoes by now—and because he smells each and every sneaker he’s looked at, that means he’s smelled over a million, too. Folks at the Stadium Goods consignment desk, which resembles a UPS store with its L-shaped counter separating customers from stacks of boxes, typically laugh, Zac says, but the joke’s on them—he’s never been fooled.</p>

<p>Smell is especially important when it comes to these Dunks, a shoe of the hypest order that, unlike the latest Jordan retro or Yeezy release, doesn’t regularly come through Stadium Goods. Zac doesn’t so much look for a specific scent as he does try and sniff out the noxious signs of a fraud: “This fume-y, fake glue smell,” he explains. Real shoes, he says, have a singular aroma—there is New Shoe smell the same way there is New Car smell. It’s syrupy and medicinal—a cure-all, maybe, for bad outfits.</p>
