1. **Create the HTML Structure**:
   - Started with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration to define the document as HTML5.
   - Added the `<html>` tag to begin the HTML document.
   - In the `<head>` section, included meta-information such as the character set using `<meta charset="utf-8">` and set the title of the page with the `<title>Shoe Store</title>` tag.
   - Linked an external Google font and a CSS stylesheet for styling the website.

2. **Add Navigation Menu**:
   - Inside the `<header>` tag, created a navigation (`<nav>`) section.
   - Used an unordered list (`<ul>`) to create the navigation menu with list items (`<li>`) for each link.
   - Each list item contains an anchor tag (`<a>`) linking to different pages of the website: Home, Sell Your Shoe, Tips, Nike, Adidas, and Contact Us. 

3. **Main Content Area**:
   - Created an `<article>` section within the body to hold the main content. 
   - Added a `<div>` with the id "Home" to represent the home section.
   - Included a heading (`<h2>`) for the article title and a paragraph (`<p>`) with a time element (`<time>`) for the post date and author.
   - Added multiple paragraphs detailing the story about the booming sneaker resale industry. 

4. **Footer Section**:
   - Defined a `<footer>` section at the bottom of the page.
   - Included contact information with a heading (`<h2>Contact:</h2>`), location details, and operating hours.
   - Provided an email link using the `<a>` tag with a `mailto:` attribute and a phone number.
   - Added a sign-up form for early access to news and new shoe drops, including an email input field and a disclaimer about age and consent.
   - Finished with a small print disclaimer and copyright information.

5. **Styling**:
   - Linked an external CSS file using the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` tag in the head section to apply styles to the HTML elements.
   - Applied web fonts by linking to Google Fonts, enhancing the website's visual appeal.
